Description: 
This project examines gene expression during the normal spawning timing of corals that did and did not spawn. Samples were collected from 3 replicate _Montipora capitata_ colonies for each condition at 18:00, 20:00 and 00:00 the night of 6/6/16. RNA extracted from samples was prepped using Illumina TruSeq Sample Prep v2 Guide and sequenced 2x150bp on the Illumina MiSeq.
